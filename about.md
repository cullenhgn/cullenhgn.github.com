I was born in Texas and raised in Oklahoma, which is also where I attended the University of Oklahoma studying Geophysics.  I'm currently living in Houston where I work for an upstream Oil & Gas company in the New Ventures/Business Development team.

I really enjoy working in the Oil & Gas Industry, it allows me the chance to see some very cool (and big) data and also explore that data in a large variety of fancy software.  With that said, any chance that I can get would prefer to work with scripts and command line tools.  Maybe it's just an attempt for grad-school nostalgia, but I think it is a true skill to be able to manipulate/analyze data through code.

Anyways enough about that!

Here is some more random information about me.

I'm a nerd for video/board games, indie music/movies, and restaurant weeks is my favorite time of year in Houston.  Terrible at keeping up with social media (but I do have a [`photo-blog`][photo-blog] I've been updating since 2012).  My favorite TV show is The Wire.  I enjoy camping, secretly want a motorcycle (won't ever go through with it), and the first time I ever left the states was when I went to China.
