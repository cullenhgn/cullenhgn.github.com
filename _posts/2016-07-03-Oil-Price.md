Learning the basics of plotting data with Python is probably what these first few posts will be about.

This first example is showing how it's pretty easy to download a csv file, and then convert it into a pandas dataframe to whip up a quick figure.  You can see that this can be done with just a handful of code (probably even less than I used).  The full [`ipython notebook`][notebook] has the same code below but with a little more explanation, and shows one of the *small* qwerks I ran into.

***

{% highlight python %}
# import libraries
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# change the default plotting style to something nicer
plt.style.use('ggplot')

# import csv file
# data from https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DCOILWTICO/downloaddata
df = pd.read_csv('DCOILWTICO.csv')

# convert date column to datetime
df['DATE'] = pd.to_datetime(df['DATE'])

# setup basic line plot, change line color from red to green
ax = df.plot(x='DATE', y='VALUE', color = '#31a354', linewidth = .5)

# change the legend lable from "VALUE" to "Oil Price ($)"
L = plt.legend(loc = 'upper left', fontsize = 'x-large')
L.get_texts()[0].set_text('Oil Price ($)')

# edit axis labels and font size
ax.set_title("Price of Oil for last 30 years", fontsize = 18)
ax.set_xlabel("Time", fontsize = 14)
ax.set_ylabel("Oil Price ($)", fontsize = 14)

# save the figure at a good resolution
fig = ax.get_figure()
fig.savefig('oilprice.png', dpi=600)

plt.show()
{% endhighlight %}

This results in the nice figure below.

One of my long term goals is to eventually create a permanent dashboard that reads data such as the current oil/natural gas price, rig counts, and other reports which will be automatically generated into nice looking displays.

But for now this is a great start!
