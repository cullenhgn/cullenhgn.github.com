I've been wanting to start a blog dedicated to my attempts/progress at coding for quite awhile now.  Finally getting around to this thanks to github offering [`free hosting`][free hosting]!  This was a natural fit since the blog is really just a way for me to keep track of random coding projects, which would likely have been kept on github anyways.

Most of my projects will probably be Python based, since I'm looking to become more proficient with the overall scientific Python based libraries.  This means you can expect lots of posts related to numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.

Aside from that we'll just see where this crazy project leads!

P.S.
There were lot of little things that went in to getting this first post together, which I'll probably go into more detail later.  For instance, this site is put together with markdown using [`Jekyll`][Jekyll], and the "Hello World" image was made with the matplotlib [`xkcd styling`][xkcd styling]! So I already learned quite a bit with just this first post.
